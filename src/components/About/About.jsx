                <ol>
                    <li><p>Implemented a Quality Evaluation model that assures the removal of facial features from 3D Brain MRI scans by mapping them into four different 2D projections. It removes all the facial feaures that can be used to identify the subject. This model is very handy for analysis since researchers would always prefer images that are deidentified.</p></li>
                    <li>Implemented Brain Cut model to ensure that all the brain tissues in MRI image are intact and not removed as a part of the deidentification process.This model can help researchers evaluate the image since deskulling can remove important voxels from the brain image.</li>
                    <li>Training data is generated by processing collected T1-weighted images using the BET and BSE tool and surveyed the data in our research group to label it for classification.Pre-processing steps were done to make sure the scaling and sizing of each image is same.</li>
                    <li>Predicted images that had presence of face tissue or brain tissue with 92 percent of accuracy, providing researcher not only an investigative insight into the MRI image but also saving a lot of time going through all the images present in the study without worrying the identification issues of the patient.</li>

              <li><b>Graduate Research Assistant | Multimedia Lab | Clemson University, US |</b></li>
              <ol>
                <li><p>Integrated Deep learning based models into the Dyslexia Data Consortium, a web platform created to better understand dyslexia and developmental language disorders in general, as well as to provide data to aid replication and data sharing.</p></li>
                <li><p>Various neuroimaging metrics were generated by CAT12 toolbox for all T1-weighted images and were integrated into the website to help the researchers understand dyslexia more clearly. Integrated necessary different neuroimaging fractional intensity threshold images from the FSL BET tool.</p></li>
                <li><p>Developed a Data quality template for visual inspection of the images facilitated with CRUD operations. Worked on Django ORM API to create and insert data into tables and access the database. Client side validation done using the sweetalert, a WAI-ARIA specification to increase user accessibility.</p></li>
                <li>Administered everyday operations of website and made necessary changes on a regular basis. Suggested modifications to the researchers to enhance the usability of the website. Performed periodic assessments on website traffic to generate reports on traffic activities.</li>
