                <li>Implemented Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, one of the recent advancements in the 
                  field of Reinforcement Learning.&nbsp;Proximal Policy Optimization is a policy gradient method
                  for Reinforcement Learning.
                </li>
                <li>The whole idea of this algorithm in this environment in layman terms is to train the agent to make the maximum use of trajectories to learn hopping on the tiles.
                  It uses Actor-Critic Neural Network and is used in environments with either discrete or continuous 
                  action spaces.&nbsp;This algorithm is trained for many epochs until the environment is solved.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Initially the agent takes 100 to 150 trajectories to take one proper hop on the tile, but after almost 500 iterations the agent takes only 
                  six to seven trajectories for a sequence of successful hops.
                  This algorithm is implemented from scratch and tested on the Hopper Bullet Environment (MUJUCO)
                  using Generalized Advantage Estimator with a capacity of batch size of 5000 samples 
                  of trajectories.
